    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers.

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",

    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    "### K-Nearest Neighbor\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "The k-nearest neighbor algorithm is one of the simplest machine learning models. It is instance-based so it does not need a parametric mathematical model to fit. It simply stores the training data points and calculates the distances between a test data point and its k neighbors to get a majority vote as the prediction. Given that it's instance-based and non-parametric, it does not need to be trained but querying is slow. Some real-world applications include face recognition after feature extraction, kNN semantic search and recommender systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "\n",
    "The strength of kNN is that it is easy to understand, easy to train (actually no training). It performs well if the data is low-dimensional and the features are relatively nicely distributed and well-understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "When the data is high-dimensional, Euclidean distance becomes less useful since most high-dimensional vectors have similar distances from each other. Hence, kNN performs poorly on high-dimensional data. Also, if the data size is too large, storing the data to make prediction is much more expensive. There are techniques to reduce the data size and get similar performance, such as [Condensed Nearest Neighbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm#CNN_for_data_reduction). To avoid high dimensionality, dimensionality reduction methods such as PCA or Neural Networks for feature learning are usually applied before applying kNN. kNN also performs badly when there are local data structures. A more sophisticated model such as neural networks or SVM with Gaussian kernel can learn better in that case.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "This data has relatively low dimensionality, which is a good indicator that kNN can be applied as a baseline method. It also has some variables which might not follow a typical distribution and a potential analytical mathematical description, but can be used to simply compare against each other to get a similarity score. So long as similarity (distance) is a good metric to group and classify this data, kNN could work reasonably well.\n",

SVMs with kernels can perform well on complexed high dimensional data. They are used in computer vision tasks extensively with extracted features. They are also commonly used in text categorization, and in biology to classify complex protein structures with very high accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "\n",
    "SVMs are powerful because it can be trained to produce complex decision boundaries. Unlike linear logistic regression and decision trees, it is less affected by outliers and can use the kernel trick to produce non-linear decision boundaries if need be. It is flexible in terms of model complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest weakness of SVM is that it's costly to train. Usually it takes a lot more time to train than a logisitic regression classifier. And it is claimed that SVMs can perform poorly on data with heterogenous features, meaning the features are not related to each other and have very different scale and skewed distributions. Other than that, it's hard to find a univerally true weakness of SVMs for all problems. They are usually customized to avoid certain pitfalls in certain scenarios so that the performance can still be very good.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another aspect is that SVMs are hard to interpret. It performs complex transformations and the resulting decision boundary is not as interpretable as the result of logistic regression or decision tree.\n",

    "    \n",
    "4. Random Forests are pretty **tough to beat**. Although you can typically find a model that beats RFs for any given dataset (typically a neural net or some boosting algorithm), it’s never by much, and it usually takes much longer to build and tune said model than it took to build the Random Forest. This is why they make for excellent benchmark models.\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. It’s really **hard to build a bad Random Forest**! Since random forests are not very sensitive to the specific hyper-parameters used, they don’t require a lot of tweaking and fiddling to get a decent model, just use a large number of trees and things won’t go terribly awry. Most Random Forest implementations have sensible defaults for the rest of the parameters.\n",
    "    \n",
    "6. **Versatility**. Random Forest are applicable to a wide variety of modeling tasks, they work well for regression tasks, work very well for classification taks(and even produce decently calibrated probability scores), and even though I’ve never tried it myself, they can be used for cluster analysis.\n",
    "    \n",
    "7. **Simplicity**. If not of the resulting model, then of the learning algorithm itself. The basic RF learning algorithm can be written in a few lines of code. There’s a certain irony about that. But a sense of elegance as well.\n",
    "    \n",
    "8. **Lots of excellent, free, and open-source implementations**. You can find a good implementation in almost all major ML libraries and toolkits. R, scikit-learn and Weka jump to mind for having exceptionally good implementations.\n",

    "Random forest has really good name. It's just a number of decision trees put together and it makes prediction by getting the majority vote out of the predictions by all the trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision tree - one tree simply splits each feature into two areas by a threshold value. For example, to tell whether the income is greater than 50K, it could split `Age` at 30, assumes income is larger than 50K if Age > 30, otherwise income is less than 50K. It splits all features in this way and finally produces a number of rules, if feature 1 is greater than X, feature 2 less than Y, feature 3 less than Z, etc. then income is larger than 50K. All these rules are the result of training. Once the tree prediction is as close to the truth as possible, it stops training. Each rule labels a patch of area in the data with income being greater than 50K or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forest is a collection of these trees. Each tree takes in a subset of the data by sampling with replacement. **Each tree also takes in a subset of features.** The trees are trained. To predict a new instance, random forest looks at all predictions from all the trees and predict the point as the majority vote from the tree results. This is called bagging (bootstrap aggregating) with decision trees. It is a great way to avoid overfitting the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to note is that RF trees take in **partial features instead of all features, this is the one difference between RF and Bagged Decision Trees**. For the latter, each tree is trained on all features. RF has 2 parameters - the number of trees and number of features for each tree. Bagged Decision Trees only have one parameter - ([Ref](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-differences-between-bagged-trees-and-random-forests))"

Capital gain comes next. This is an obvious miss on my end. It is quite obvious that the higher the capital gain, the wealthier the person is. Marital status is another one I missed. It turns out that married people are wealthier. Education comes last in the five. I over-estimated the importance of education on income, at least for this particular dataset."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
